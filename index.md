# Modernising Health and Aged Care Payments Services Program

## Background
Each year, through health and aged care programs, the Government makes in excess of 600 million payments to individuals and health and aged care providers, worth approximately $50bn.

The current IT systems supporting health and aged care payments are a complex web, which have evolved over 30 years. The Medicare systems alone comprise over 200 applications and 90 databases, many of which are aging and based on obsolete technology.

The systems are no longer fit for purpose. They are unable to support the level of flexibility and service innovation that users – individuals and providers – and the Government expect.

To address this challenge, the Government has decided to replace the IT systems supporting health and aged care payments.

## About the program

The Government has established the Modernising Health and Aged Care Payments Services Program (the Program) to deliver the transformation of the health and aged care payments services and the implementation of a new Digital Payments Platform.

The vision for the Program is to deliver a new Digital Payments Platform that supports a digital-first (or digitally enabled) service delivery business model and simpler, faster, easier services for users.

## Government Objectives

The new Digital Payments Platform should meet the following objectives:

- supports contemporary, best practice health, aged care and related veterans’ payments services now and into the future;
- supports a seamless experience for users of government services;
- supports the rapid implementation of new programs and policies, including any new, efficient, citizen-centric health and aged care models;
- uses innovation to support continuous improvement in claiming and payments services, in line with the Commonwealth’s Digital Service Standard;
- supports streamlined, high integrity, secure service delivery, minimising manual touch points;
- delivers leading practice data capture and analytics capability; and
- meets all relevant legislative, regulatory and policy requirements, including privacy, cybersecurity and data law, including that it ensures security capabilities are best practice and all security requirements are met, both within and between each service layer.
