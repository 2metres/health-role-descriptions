# Modernising Health and Aged Care Payments Services Program

## Background
Each year, through health and aged care programs, the Government makes in excess of 600 million payments to individuals and health and aged care providers, worth approximately $50bn.

The current IT systems supporting health and aged care payments are a complex web, which have evolved over 30 years. The Medicare systems alone comprise over 200 applications and 90 databases, many of which are aging and based on obsolete technology.

The systems are no longer fit for purpose. They are unable to support the level of flexibility and service innovation that users – individuals and providers – and the Government expect.

To address this challenge, the Government has decided to replace the IT systems supporting health and aged care payments.

## About the program

The Government has established the Modernising Health and Aged Care Payments Services Program (the Program) to deliver the transformation of the health and aged care payments services and the implementation of a new Digital Payments Platform.

The vision for the Program is to deliver a new Digital Payments Platform that supports a digital-first (or digitally enabled) service delivery business model and simpler, faster, easier services for users.
